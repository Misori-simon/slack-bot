# Wiki and Ebay Srap_bot for Slack

## Definition

> I have used the web scrapping and bot building to build a bot that will return to you the wiki definition of the word you enter after the ```wiki``` command and the first two ebay results for any item you enter after the ```buy``` command.

## About the Project

The objective of this project is to realize a working bot for slack. The bot should be able to assist the workspace in which it is installed to execute certain tasks as in this case __web scraping__.
I used the slack-ruby-bot for the bot library and Nokogiri gem for scrapping. All dependencies will be listed below.
